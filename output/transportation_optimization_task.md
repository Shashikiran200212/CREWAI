Revised 3-Day Hakone Itinerary for 4 People (Budget: ¥50,000)

**Transportation Plan:**

* **To/From Hakone:**  The most cost-effective way to travel to and from Hakone from your starting point (e.g., Tokyo airport or city) needs further research, dependent on your arrival and departure locations. Consider comparing prices for highway buses, trains, and potentially a combination of both, depending on your specific locations.  This is not included in the ¥50,000 budget.

* **Within Hakone:**  The itinerary will primarily use local buses (Hakone Tozan Bus) rather than trains, as they are generally cheaper. Specific bus routes and schedules will need to be determined closer to the travel dates using the official Hakone Tozan Bus website or other relevant resources.  The estimated cost for bus transport within Hakone is ¥5000 (This is a rough estimate, and the exact cost will vary depending on the routes used).
