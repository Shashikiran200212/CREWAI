The original budget of ¥50,000 is insufficient for a 3-day Hakone trip for 4 people, even with cost-cutting measures.  The revised budget, incorporating cost-saving strategies like budget-friendly accommodation (¥16000), packed lunches (¥4000), and a reduction in activities (¥20000), still totals ¥90,000. To stay within the ¥50,000 budget, significant compromises would need to be made to activities, accommodation, or transportation, or the trip duration shortened.  A more realistic budget would be closer to ¥90,000.
